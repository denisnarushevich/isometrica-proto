*About*

This is browser game, or its engine, which making is inspired from TTD, OpenTTD and SimCity.
Currently there is no strict game direction or scenario, basicaly this is *unlimited*(65k * 65k tiles) procedurally generated world on fly,
where users can build building and that way earning some money. More money you have => bigger building you can build and and earn more income.
There is plans on making it more RPGish like, where each player would have avatar...kinda "eRepublik".

Game world can have regions, hich is defined as some amount of tiles around city centers or landmarks.
Like in TTD, each city is developing automaticaly, but user can build road tiles and houses.

In future there should be resource objects, and different building will produce and require some resources.
Two building can be connected by road, and this way resources will be somehow accessible for each other of two. 
such connection and resource exchange should generate route where AI driven vehicles will deliver resources.

Currently game is in very early stages, and I'm looking for contributors, or, if I'm lucky enough, gamedesigners.



*Technologies used*

Would like to have JS everywhere. JS+NodeJS+MongoDB.

3rd party libraries used:
Backbone,
Underscore,
Jquery
...

I'm trying to avoid using libraries, cause its decreasing overall performance.


*Performance*

At the moment 
Currently, best performance can be expierenced on machines that supports webgl for canvas rendering, but classical cpu rendered is good too.
I have 30-40fps @ 1920x1080 on my i3 notebook with intel hd3000.


*Licensing*

I guess it's Licensed under GPL.


*Interesting & usefull resources*
